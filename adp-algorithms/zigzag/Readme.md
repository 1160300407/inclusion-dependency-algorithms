Zigzag
======

## Implementation
* Set operations are used for the hypergraph operations
* The validation-strategy package is used. Zigzag needs an error margin validation in the g3 method.
* Unary IND input is used and then the first k levels of the hypergraph are generated by checking every IND with the validation strategy.

## To-Dos
* Use guava Graph to generate the graph one time in the beginning and then use real graph operations.
This avoids generating the powerSet each time the next candidates are searched. E.g. getCandidatesOnNextLevel, generalizeSet and others.
* Provide multiple validation strategies which also calculate the error marging. Ideally a wrapper is used turning each query into a error marging query.
* Replace the generation of the first k levels of INDs with an IND input that returns more than only unary INDs.

## Implications
Zigzag generates a graph from the unary INDs it gets. This means that with the unary INDs the graph is already predetermined.
This means the unary INDs could generate INDs that will never be satisfied/valid. This includes:
#### Problems:
1. INDs inside the same table => For 2 or more tables this will generate INDs with multiple tables on one side
2. INDs between tables, where INDs of one table can be both dependant and referenced => Multiple tables on one side
3. INDs between tables, where one IND is both dependant and referenced => Multiple tables on one side + same column on 2 sides: AC <= DA
4. INDs between tables, where one IND is part of >=2 INDs => Duplicate columns on one side, e.g. ABC <= DDE

#### Solutions:
1. Filterd out on generation of unary IND Map (dep -> ref) with _notInTheSameTable_
2. Added to unsatisfied on IND check with _hasMultipleTablesPerSide_
3. Added to unsatisfied on IND check with _hasMultipleTablesPerSide_
4. Added to unsatisfied (as in the paper) on IND check with _hasDuplicates_

These solutions have to be checked, 
if it is necessary to use more than 2 tables with one table being the dependant and the other the referenced.
Currently no INDs inside the same table are found (see 1.) and when using more than 2 tables, some INDs may not be found.
